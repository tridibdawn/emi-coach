## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `Base` connect `Community 0` to `Community 2`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.015) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `ready()` connect `Community 2` to `Community 0`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.013) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 2 inferred relationships involving `Base` (e.g. with `Settings` and `Alembic env. No financial ledger models exist in Phase 1.`) actually correct?**
  _`Base` has 2 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 2 inferred relationships involving `Settings` (e.g. with `Base` and `Server metadata only. No financial ledger tables.`) actually correct?**
  _`Settings` has 2 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **Are the 2 inferred relationships involving `ready()` (e.g. with `get_settings()` and `check_database()`) actually correct?**
  _`ready()` has 2 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **What connects `No SQLAlchemy financial models. This module is scanned by the privacy CI check.` to the rest of the system?**
  _1 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
